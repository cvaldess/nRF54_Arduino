# Agent guide for this repo

## What this repo is

Arduino BSP for **Nordic nRF54L05 / nRF54L10 / nRF54L15 / nRF54LM20A**
with the **s145 SoftDevice v10.0.1**. Derived from
`Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino` and reworked for nRF54L peripherals.

**PlatformIO only.** Consumed exclusively through
[meshtastic/platform-nordicnrf54](https://github.com/meshtastic/platform-nordicnrf54).
There is no `platform.txt`, `boards.txt`, or Arduino IDE / Board
Manager support. Do not propose adding them.

## Project conventions

### Commit messages

- **Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI attribution) trailers.**
- Imperative subject, terse but specific. Reference SHAs of related
  prior commits where helpful.
- Multi-paragraph body for non-trivial changes: state the symptom, the
  root cause, and what the fix does.

### Code style

- Default to writing no comments. Add one only when the *why* is
  non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a workaround, a behavior that
  would surprise a reader. Don't explain *what* the code does.
- Don't add backwards-compat shims, dead branches, or speculative
  abstractions. Trust framework guarantees.
- C++17 is the standard; no RTTI, no exceptions (set by the platform).

### Cross-repo dependencies

Some fixes belong in `platform-nordicnrf54`
(`builder/frameworks/arduino/adafruit.py`), not here:

- Build flags (`-mcpu`, `-mfpu`, include paths, CPPDEFINES)
- Board JSON metadata
- Upload tooling
- LDF / library resolution

Some fixes belong here (the framework):

- C/C++ source code, headers, linker scripts, variants
- `library.properties` for bundled libraries
- `nrfx_config.h` and per-driver guards

When in doubt: if the change affects how the compiler is invoked, it's
platform-side. If it affects what gets compiled, it's framework-side.

## Architectural fixed points (don't accidentally break these)

### `nrf54l_compat.h` is force-included by the platform

The platform's
[`builder/frameworks/arduino/adafruit.py`](https://github.com/meshtastic/platform-nordicnrf54/blob/master/builder/frameworks/arduino/adafruit.py)
adds `-include cores/nRF5/nordic/nrf54l_compat.h` to CCFLAGS. This
aliases nRF52 peripheral names (`NRF_PWM0..2`, `NRF_TWIM0/1`,
`NRF_SPIM0/2`, `NRF_UARTE0/1`, `NRF_GPIOTE`, `NRF_TIMER2`, etc.) to
their nRF54L equivalents. **Most of the Adafruit code compiles
unmodified because of this header.**

Scope rule for `nrf54l_compat.h`: **symbol-name aliases only**.
Register-shape changes (split-bank `INTENSETn`, split
`DRIVE0`/`DRIVE1` fields) must NOT be aliased — the nrfx HAL uses
`#if defined(...)` checks on the legacy macros as chip-detection
markers, and aliasing them makes the HAL take the wrong branch.
Rewrite the consuming source in those cases (see `WInterrupts.c`
and `wiring_digital.c` for two existing precedents).

### nrfx driver gating is test-driven

Every driver `.c` file in `cores/nRF5/nordic/nrfx/drivers/src/` is
wrapped in `#if NRFX_CHECK(NRFX_<X>_ENABLED) ... #endif`, and
`cores/nRF5/nordic/nrfx_config.h` defaults every driver to
`_ENABLED = 1`. **Drivers are disabled only after the compiler flags
a specific error.** Current disable list (with the error that prompted
each):

- `NRFX_ADC_ENABLED = 0` — `NRF_ADC / ADC_IRQn` undeclared (nRF51 legacy ADC)
- `NRFX_BELLBOARD_ENABLED = 0` — `NRF_BELLBOARD` undeclared (nRF54H IPC); also the source of cryptic `nrfx_utils.h:517` errors via `NRFX_OFFSETOF`
- `NRFX_CLOCK_LFCLK_ENABLED = 0` — `NRFX_CLOCK_CONFIG_LF_SRC` undefined; LFCLK is started by `cores/nRF5/wiring.c` directly
- `NRFX_IPCT_ENABLED = 0` — IPCT is nRF54H DPPI cross-domain routing; the helper in `nrfx/helpers/internal/nrfx_gppiv1_ipct.c` `#errors` "Platform not supported" otherwise
- `NRFX_VEVIF_ENABLED = 0` — VPR-coprocessor-side driver; the app-core MDK has `VPR00_IRQHandler` but not the `VPRCLIC_*_IRQn` vectors `nrfx_vevif.c` needs
- `NRFX_USBD_ENABLED = NRFX_USBREG_ENABLED = 0` — no USB peripheral on nRF54L

When a new driver fails to compile, add it to the disabled list in
`nrfx_config.h` with a one-line comment naming the error. Do not
preemptively disable drivers just because the framework doesn't link
against them — the linker eliminates unused code via `--gc-sections`.

### `wiring_analog_nRF52.c` is `#if NRF52`-gated

The nRF54L SAADC implementation lives in
`cores/nRF5/wiring_analog_nRF54L.c`. nRF54L's SAADC differs from nRF52
in five ways: 0.9 V internal reference (not 0.6 V), multiplier gain
enum (`Gain2_8` = 2/8, not `Gain1_6` = 1/6), TACQ as a count of 125 ns
steps (`(TACQ + 1) x 125 ns`, not a microsecond enum; `analogSampleTime()`
still takes microseconds and converts), byte-count `MAXCNT` (not sample
count), structured PSELP
(`CONNECT | PORT | PIN`, not `AnalogInput0..7`). Don't try to merge
the two — they're genuinely different peripherals.

### No MBR: the application forwards SoftDevice interrupts

s145 ships without an MBR. The DFU bootloader owns RRAM `0x0`, the
application starts at `0x8000` with its own vector table and forwards the
SoftDevice-owned interrupts and SVCs (`cores/nRF5/nordic/sd_isr.S`) to the
handler table the SoftDevice publishes at its base (`__softdevice_start__`).
The SoftDevice reset handler runs once from `wiring.c` before any `sd_*`
call. Nothing in the vector table may shadow the forwarded entries.

### Linker symbols pin the memory map

`cores/nRF5/linker/nrf54_common.ld` defines `__flash_arduino_start` and
`__flash_arduino_end` so InternalFS / `flash_nrf5x.c` work
chip-independently, and `__bootloader_peer_data` (`ORIGIN(NOINIT)`) for
`BLEDfu.cpp`. Each chip script sets `__flash_arduino_size` and
`__softdevice_start__`. Per-chip values (from `nrf54l<chip>_s145_v10.ld` and
`nrf54lm20a_s145_v10.ld`):

| Chip | App FLASH | InternalFS | DFU settings page | SoftDevice |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| nRF54L05 | `0x8000 – 0x47000` | `0x47000 – 0x4E000` | `0x4F000` | `0x5A800` |
| nRF54L10 | `0x8000 – 0xC7000` | `0xC7000 – 0xCE000` | `0xCF000` | `0xDA800` |
| nRF54L15 | `0x8000 – 0x147000` | `0x147000 – 0x14E000` | `0x14F000` | `0x15A800` |
| nRF54LM20A | `0x8000 – 0x1C9000` | `0x1C9000 – 0x1D1000` | `0x1D1000` | `0x1DA800` |

RAM ends at `0x2003FF80`; the bootloader keeps its BLE peer data and the
double-reset marker in the last 128 bytes. Both sides must agree, so change
the layout in the bootloader repo's `linker/` scripts in the same step.

### SoftDevice files are split by SoC family, not by SoC

`sdk-nrf-bm` ships s145 under a per-family directory (`nrf54l`, `nrf54lm`,
`nrf54ls`, `nrf54lv`) holding one API header set and one hex per SoC in
that family, and this tree mirrors that:

```
cores/nRF5/nordic/softdevice/s145_nrf54l_10.0.1_API/   L05 / L10 / L15
cores/nRF5/nordic/softdevice/s145_nrf54lm_10.0.1_API/  LM20A
bootloader/s145/10.0.1/nrf54l/s145_nrf54l{05,10,15}_10.0.1_softdevice.hex
bootloader/s145/10.0.1/nrf54lm/s145_nrf54lm20_10.0.1_softdevice.hex
```

The board JSON picks the family with `build.softdevice.sd_family` and the
hex with `build.softdevice.sd_soc`; `build.mcu` names the real part
(`nrf54lm20a`) and no longer feeds either path.

The two API header sets are **byte-identical** upstream and here, so a fix
to one (`nrf_nvic.h` is a hand-written shim, not a Nordic file) has to be
applied to the other or they silently disagree. Keep them in sync rather
than letting them diverge; only re-vendoring from a newer `sdk-nrf-bm` may
legitimately split them apart.

### XIAO Wire routes to TWIM22

The default `Wire` instance (`NRF_TWIM0` → `NRF_TWIM20` via compat) shares
the SERIAL20 instance with the XIAO console UARTE20. The XIAO variants
override `WIRE_TWIM` / `WIRE_TWIS` / `WIRE_IRQN` / `WIRE_IRQ_HANDLER` in
their `variant.h` to point at TWIM22 on D4/D5. Don't remove the override
without verifying the routing on actual hardware.

nRF54L serial peripherals ignore `PSEL` writes while enabled: configure
pins first, then enable. A TWIM NACK leaves the bus held until a STOP
task.

### `Serial` aliases to `Serial1`

nRF54L has no USB peripheral. `Uart.h` defines `Serial` as
`Serial1` so portable Arduino sketches compile. On XIAO boards
`Serial1` runs through the on-board SAMD11 USB-CDC bridge.
